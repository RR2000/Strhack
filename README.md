# Strhack

## Project History
In 2020, I started working on Strhack, an Android application. Strhack is a tool that should record your course (running or biking) and should allow you to see the statistics and share your .gpx with your friends, via other apps or Strhack itself.

## Revival and Improvements
The project has now been revived, and several improvements are gonna be made to ensure its successful completion. One major issue identified was the lack of appropriate methodologies, such as Model–View–ViewModel (MVVC), which led to codebase complexity.
( I was young, don't judge me :) )

## TODOs
So, the idea is to:
<ul>
<li>add altitude correction [implementing...]</li>
<li>restyle graphic to improve usability</li>
<li>add import from you and your friends' .gpx</li>
<li>add comparison between your .gpx and your friends' .gpx statistics</li>
<li>find a way to share without using a database (external app and/or p2p)</li>
</ul>
